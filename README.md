SMS Spam Detection

Project Description:
This project implements an SMS Spam Classifier using Python and Scikit-learn.
It loads the SMS Spam Collection dataset, performs text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization), trains a classification model (Logistic Regression), and evaluates performance using accuracy score and a confusion matrix visualization.

Libraries Used:
Pandas - Data loading & manipulation
NumPy - Numerical computations
NLTK - Natural Language Processing (tokenization, stopword removal)
Scikit-learn - Machine learning model training & evaluation
Matplotlib / Seaborn - Data visualization & confusion matrix

Output Example
Model accuracy score

Confusion matrix visualization

Spam/Ham classification results
